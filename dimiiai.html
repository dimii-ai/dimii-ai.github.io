                Unlike traditional systems that raise vague anomaly alerts without context, Dimii AI flags only what truly matters. It doesn’t just detect something unusual—it understands when an attack is actually unfolding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dimii connects each alert to the broader sequence of events, recognizing patterns, predicting next steps, and helping your team focus on real threats—not noise. It supports your analysts in triaging alerts, uncovering vulnerabilities, and planning effective responses—faster and with greater clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is powered by rich data harvested from our deception platform—processed through AI models designed with transparency, context, and interpretability at their core.
